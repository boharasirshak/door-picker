# TODO

[x] Change the format of the schema with `x,x,x (x quanity)` in the format.

- Mention issue #2

[ ] Add one more dropdown justifying the quanity field.

[ ] Each quantity in the features table is unique, so rather than a many to many table, we rolling with 18k rows in the feature table, each having their own id and the composite primary key being `id - quantity - name`

[ ] Ask the client about the things that mentioned to remove, and why!

# Notes

1. Currently I am assuming that the quanityt with no комплект mentioned, is 1. Ask a question about it.

2. You said that "3-2-1 scheme requires 2 pieces." I analyzed the excel files, but I couldn't find any row that mentions that the 3-2-1 scheme has 2 pieces. Please provide me with more information about it.
